Owner of Green X Recycling

Lives in Montana, is a community leader.

Biza started his company 6 months ago. 
Most of his life, Biza has either been a gardener or waste collecter, but heâ€™s always wanted to run his own business.

He noticed that the area he lives in is not clean because people don't know how to recycle and that there is not a lot of job opportunities.

He decided to open a company that helps people in the community earn a living and at the same time keep the area clean
